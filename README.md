## Be Warned!

**Licenses are prescription-strength legal devices.  If you need terms for a project, don't be an idiot.  Hire a lawyer.  A good one will ask good questions. They may decide this form fits your needs.**

**Do _not_ put confidential information about you, your work, or your clients in issues or pull requests.  Do _not_ ask for legal advice on GitHub, or try to disguise requests for legal advice as general questions or hypotheticals.  You don't want advice from anybody dumb enough to fall for that.**

## Reading

You can read this license.

Big Time is a [flipped form](https://flippedform.com) in everyday English.  If something doesn't make sense, that's the terms' fault, not yours.  Please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/berneout/big-time-public-license/issues/new) so we can fix it.
